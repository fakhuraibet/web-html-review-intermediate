<h1 style="color: crimson;">SPIDERMAN</h1>

<p style="color: midnightblue;font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Spider-Man, comic-book character who was the original everyman superhero. In Spider-Man’s first story, in Marvel Comics’ 
    Amazing Fantasy, no. 15 (1962), American teenager Peter Parker, a poor sickly orphan, is bitten by a radioactive spider.
     As a result of the bite, he gains superhuman strength, speed, and agility along with the ability to cling to walls.
      Writer Stan Lee and illustrator Steve Ditko created Spider-Man as a filler story for a canceled anthology series. 
      At the time, a teenage lead hero was unheard of in comic books. However, young readers responded powerfully to Peter Parker, 
      prompting an ongoing title and, ultimately, a media empire, including
     video games, several animated and one live-action television series, a live-action film franchise, and a Broadway musical.</p>
