<p style="color: antiquewhite; font-size: large; font-family: sans-serif;">Iron Man, American comic book superhero,
     a mainstay of Marvel Comics, who first appeared in 1963 in Tales of Suspense no. 39.
     His creation is officially credited to four people: writer and editor Stan Lee, who plotted the first story; 
     his brother Larry Lieber, who scripted it; artist Don Heck, who drew it; and Jack Kirby,who designed Iron Manâ€™s original armoured 
     battlesuit. Iron Man has appeared as the star of his own comic book series, as a regular guest in
